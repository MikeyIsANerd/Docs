Pedro Pathing relies on **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
controllers** to ensure precise path-following performance. The following pages
will walk you through tuning the various PID controllers for translational,
heading, and drive.

## Single vs. Dual PID System

In Pedro Pathing, you can choose between using one or two PID controllers for
each correction type (translational, heading, and drive).

### Single PID System

In a single PID system, a single PID is responsible for managing all errors.
This is the simplest option and is the quickest to get started with.

Since a single PID system is the default, you don't have to do anything
special to use it.

### Dual PID System

In a dual PID system, there is a **main PID** that handles larger errors and
a **secondary PID** for smaller corrections.

Advantages to using a dual PID system are:

- Better correction
- Scalable error thresholds
- Allows for more aggressive tuning

If you want to try using a dual PID system, it is recommended that you start
with drive, as it will contribute the most to a better auto.

To enable a dual PID system, set any of the following to `true` in
`FollowerConstants` in the
`Constants` file.

```java title="Constants.java"
.useSecondaryTranslationalPIDF(true)
.useSecondaryHeadingPIDF(true)
.useSecondaryDrivePIDF(true)
```

Then, tune both the main and secondary PIDs. The main PID should move the
error into the secondary PID's range without causing overshoot, and the
secondary PID should correct for small errors quickly and minimize oscillations.

## Tuning PIDs

demonstrate how to tune a PID.
