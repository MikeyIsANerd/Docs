import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

<Callout title="Prerequisites" type="info">
  Ensure that the OTOS is properly mounted and connected, and the yellow kapton
  tape has been pulled off the sensor. The OTOS
  should be connected to a REV Hub through an I2C cable (not to port 0 because
  the IMU is there).
</Callout>

## Setup

In `Constants.java`, add an instance of `OTOSConstants`. Make sure to
replace the hardware map name with the actual name.

```java title="Constants.java"
public static OTOSConstants localizerConstants = new OTOSConstants()
            .hardwareMapName("otos")
            .linearUnit(DistanceUnit.INCH)
            .angleUnit(AngleUnit.RADIANS);
```

Then, add `.OTOSLocalizer` to `createFollower`:

```java title="Constants.java"
return new FollowerBuilder(followerConstants, hardwareMap)
    .OTOSLocalizer(localizerConstants)
    /* other builder steps */
    .build();
```

## Offsets

You must specify the sensor's position relative to the center of the robot.
Measure the X and Y coordinates, and then change the value of `.offset()`.
If you would like to change the units used, you can change `.linearUnit()`
and/or `.angleUnit()`. The defaults are inches and radians, respectively.

<Callout title="Important" type="warning">
  The y axis is the left/right axis, and the x axis is the forward/backward
  axis.

  Left is positive y and forward is positive x.

  Facing forward is `PI/2` radians or `90` degrees, and clockwise rotation
  is negative.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">
  It is recommended that you run the following tests multiple times and
  average the results, as it results in more accurate localization.
</Callout>

## Linear Scalar

We will now adjust multipliers that convert encoder ticks into real-world
measurements: inches. This ensures your localizer's readings are accurate.

Since the OTOS has only one linear scalar, you can run either the forward or
lateral tuner, as they should result in very similar values.

### Option 1: Forward Tuner

In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the forward tuner.
Then, push the robot **forward 48 inches** (exactly 2 field tiles). This
distance is configurable if needed. Once you push the robot forward, two
numbers will be displayed on telemetry:

- The distance the robot thinks it has traveled
- The linear scalar; this is the number you want.

Add the linear scalar to your `OTOSConstants` by doing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.linearScalar(multiplier)
```

### Option 2: Lateral Tuner

In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the lateral tuner.
Then, push the robot **left 48 inches** (exactly 2 field tiles). This
distance is configurable if needed. Once you push the robot forward, two
numbers will be displayed on telemetry:

- The distance the robot thinks it has traveled
- The linear scalar; this is the number you want.

Add the linear scalar to your `OTOSConstants` (or modify the value in the quickstart)
by doing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.linearScalar(multiplier)
```

## Turn Tuner

The turn tuner is similar to both the forward tuner and lateral tuner, except it is
rotational. Place the robot so it aligns to a fixed reference point
(e.g., edge of a field tile).
In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the lateral tuner.
Rotate the robot **counterclockwise one full rotation**.

Add the angular scalar to your `OTOSConstants` by doing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.angularScalar(multiplier)
```

## Testing the localizer

Once you have completed the tuning steps, you can test your localizer as
described
[on the localization page](/docs/pathing/tuning/localization#localization-test).

Congratulations on successfully tuning your localizer!
