<!-- This pages gives an overview of how to create an autonomous routine using PedroPathing. It includes explanations
for creating poses, paths and the flow of logic for integration of other subsystems.

## Step One: Setting up imports and variables
Ensure to include the required imports for the autonomous. **Note: Make sure the package statement aligns 
with that of where your class files are actually located. Android Studio should automatically generate it when
creating a class**

```java title="ExampleSampleAuto.java"
import com.pedropathing.follower.Follower;
import com.pedropathing.geometry.BezierCurve;
import com.pedropathing.geometry.BezierLine;
import com.pedropathing.geometry.Pose;
import com.pedropathing.paths.PathChain;
import com.pedropathing.util.Timer;

import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.Autonomous;
import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.OpMode;

public class ExampleSampleAuto extends OpMode {
    private Follower follower;
    private Timer pathTimer;

    private int pathState;
```

## Step Two: Initializing poses
Poses are points on the field coordinate system that define the (`x`, `y`, `heading`) of your robot during the
autonomous. Below are the poses for our example autonomous:

```java title="ExampleSampleAuto.java"
    private final Pose startPose = new Pose(9, 111, Math.toRadians(-90));
    private final Pose scorePose = new Pose(16, 128, Math.toRadians(-45));
    private final Pose pickup1Pose = new Pose(30, 121, Math.toRadians(0));
    private final Pose pickup2Pose = new Pose(30, 131, Math.toRadians(0));
    private final Pose pickup3Pose = new Pose(45, 128, Math.toRadians(90));
    private final Pose parkPose = new Pose(68, 96, Math.toRadians(-90));
```

## Step Three: Path Initializing
The `buildPaths()` method creates all the paths and path chains required to define the robots movement. Each path will connect two or more poses
along with their heading interpolation to create a smooth path. There are two main types of paths:
 - **BezierLine:** Creates a straight line between two poses
 - **BezierCurve:** Create splines using three or more poses

There are also constraints which you can add to modify how your robot follows a path. To understand all of them, navigate to [Constraints](/docs/pathing/reference/constraints).
Below is our example on initializing paths.

```java title="ExampleSampleAuto.java"
private PathChain scorePreload, grabPickup1, grabPickup2, grabPickup3, scorePickup1, scorePickup2, scorePickup3, park;

public void buildPaths() {
    scorePreload = follower.pathBuilder()
            .addPath(new BezierLine(startPose, scorePose))
            .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(startPose.getHeading(), scorePose.getHeading())
            .build();

    /* This is our grabPickup1 PathChain. We are using a single path with a BezierLine, which is a straight line. */
    grabPickup1 = follower.pathBuilder()
            .addPath(new BezierLine(scorePose, pickup1Pose))
            .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(scorePose.getHeading(), pickup1Pose.getHeading())
            .build();

    /* This is our scorePickup1 PathChain. We are using a single path with a BezierLine, which is a straight line. */
    scorePickup1 = follower.pathBuilder()
            .addPath(new BezierLine(pickup1Pose, scorePose))
            .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(pickup1Pose.getHeading(), scorePose.getHeading())
            .build();

    /* This is our grabPickup2 PathChain. We are using a single path with a BezierLine, which is a straight line. */
    grabPickup2 = follower.pathBuilder()
            .addPath(new BezierLine(scorePose, pickup2Pose))
            .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(scorePose.getHeading(), pickup2Pose.getHeading())
            .build();

    /* This is our scorePickup2 PathChain. We are using a single path with a BezierLine, which is a straight line. */
    scorePickup2 = follower.pathBuilder()
            .addPath(new BezierLine(pickup2Pose, scorePose))
            .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(pickup2Pose.getHeading(), scorePose.getHeading())
            .build();

    /* This is our grabPickup3 PathChain. We are using a single path with a BezierLine, which is a straight line. */
    grabPickup3 = follower.pathBuilder()
            .addPath(new BezierLine(scorePose, pickup3Pose))
            .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(scorePose.getHeading(), pickup3Pose.getHeading())
            .build();

    /* This is our scorePickup3 PathChain. We are using a single path with a BezierLine, which is a straight line. */
    scorePickup3 = follower.pathBuilder()
            .addPath(new BezierLine(pickup3Pose, scorePose))
            .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(pickup3Pose.getHeading(), scorePose.getHeading())
            .build();

    /* This is our park PathChain. We are using a BezierCurve with 3 points, which is a curved line that is curved based off of the control point */
    grabPickup1 = follower.pathBuilder()
            .addPath(new BezierCurve(
                    scorePose,
                    // This is the control point. You can add multiple control points between your start and end poses.
                    new Pose(68, 110),
                    parkPose)
            )
            .setLinearHeadingInterpolation(scorePose.getHeading(), parkPose.getHeading())
            .build();
}
```

## Step Four: Managing Path States 
The `pathState` variable will track the robot's movement throughout the autonomous. Each state in `autonomousPathUpdate()` correlates to 
a specific action the robot is doing. The robot will transition between states based on a specified condition in the `if statement`. This prevents
premature execution and allows you to incorporate your subsystems.

Below is the example state manager with explanations on what each does and how to modify it to fit your own routine.

```java title="ExampleSampleAuto"
public void setPathState(int pState) {
    pathState = pState;
    pathTimer.resetTimer();
}

public void autonomousPathUpdate() {
    switch (pathState) {
        case 0:
            /*
                * Following the first path and setting holdEnd to true.
                * This allows the robot to hold its endpoint if the path being followed is a PathChain.
                * Without this,
                */
            follower.followPath(scorePreload, true);
            setPathState(1);
            break;
        case 1:
            /*
                * There are many ways to check if your robot has reached its target pose.
                * We will provide examples of all of them in this autonomous program.
                * follower.atParametricEnd(): Checks if the t-value (path completion value) is past your pathEndTValueConstraint.
                * follower.atPose(): Checks if the robot is at a certain pose (x, y, and heading) given error constraints for each.
                * follower.getCurrentTValue(): Gets the t-value (path completion value).
                * follower.isBusy(): Checks the robot's position and waits until the robot position is 1 inch away from its target.
                */

            /* Checks the robot's position and waits until the robot position is 1 inch away from its target. */
            if (!follower.isBusy()) {
                /*
                    * Open outtake claw
                    * This can be done with a method like "servo.setPosition(OUTTAKE_CLAW_OPEN)"
                    */
                setPathState(2);
            }
            break;
        case 2:
            /*
                * Checks to see if a second has passed before continuing with the next path.
                * We will not include these cases in the rest of the auto, but it is a way to perform actions after running paths.
                */
            if (pathTimer.getElapsedTimeSeconds() > 1.0) {
                follower.followPath(grabPickup1,true);
                setPathState(3);
            }
            break;
        case 3:
            /* Checks the robot's position and waits until the robot position is 1 inch away from its target. */
            if (!follower.isBusy()) {
                /* Grab Sample */
                follower.followPath(scorePickup1,true);
                setPathState(4);
            }
            break;
        case 4:
            // Checks if the t-value (path completion value) is past your pathEndTValueConstraint.
            if (follower.atParametricEnd()) {
                /* Score Sample */
                follower.followPath(grabPickup2,true);
                setPathState(5);
            }
            break;
        case 5:
            // Checks if the t-value (path completion value) is past your pathEndTValueConstraint.
            if (follower.atParametricEnd()) {
                /* Grab Sample */
                follower.followPath(scorePickup2,true);
                setPathState(6);
            }
            break;
        case 6:
            // Checks if the robot is at the scorePose given a x-tolerance of 1 inch, a y-tolerance of 1 inch, and a heading tolerance of 5 degrees.
            if (follower.atPose(scorePose, 1, 1, Math.toRadians(5))) {
                /* Score Sample */
                follower.followPath(grabPickup3,true);
                setPathState(7);
            }
            break;
        case 7:
            // Checks if the robot is at the grabPickup3 pose given a x-tolerance of 1 inch, a y-tolerance of 1 inch, and a heading tolerance of 5 degrees.
            if (follower.atPose(pickup3Pose, 1, 1, Math.toRadians(5))) {
                /* Grab Sample */
                follower.followPath(scorePickup3, true);
                setPathState(8);
            }
            break;
        case 8:
            // Checks if the current path's t-value (path completion value) is greater than 0.98 (98% done)
            if (follower.getCurrentTValue() > 0.98) {
                /* Score Sample */

                // A demonstration of what will happen if you choose to not holdEnd. The robot should bounce off the submersible edge.
                follower.followPath(park,false);
                setPathState(9);
            }
            break;
        case 9:
            // Checks if the current path's t-value (path completion value) is greater than 0.95 (95% done)
            if (follower.getCurrentTValue() > 0.95) {
                /* Level 1 Ascent */
                // Set the state to a case we won't use or define, so it just stops running a new path
                setPathState(-1);
            }
            break;
    }
}
```

## Step Five: Init and Loop Methods:
The initialization phase sets up our paths and timers, while the loop ensures continuous updates during autonomous.

```java title="ExampleSampleAuto"
@Override
public void loop() {
    // Loop robot movement and odometry values
    follower.update();
    // Loop the finite-state machine
    autonomousPathUpdate();

    // Feedback to Driver Hub
    telemetry.addData("path state", pathState);
    telemetry.addData("x", follower.getPose().getX());
    telemetry.addData("y", follower.getPose().getY());
    telemetry.addData("heading", follower.getPose().getHeading());
    telemetry.update();
}

/** This method is called once at the init of the OpMode. **/
@Override
public void init() {
    pathTimer = new Timer();
    follower = Constants.createFollower(hardwareMap);
    follower.setStartingPose(startPose);
    buildPaths();
}

/** This method is called once at the start of the OpMode. It runs all the setup actions, including building paths and starting the path system **/
@Override
public void start() {
    setPathState(0);
}
```
